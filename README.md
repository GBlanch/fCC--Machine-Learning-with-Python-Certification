### On some preferable practices of problem solving when coding

As similarly occurred to me when solving the challenges for the course _fCC DA with Python_, the cornerstone to tackle and solve these problems was to commence by **understanding** the **test_module** and its classes and methods. In the case of this ML course,  since an IDE is being used to develop and test the all the code, it's about understanding the  **test_function**.

[Go to _Understanding the **test_function**_](#understand-the-test-function)

Another noteworthy habit that helped me organize and map what I was coding was to utilize constants and variables as much as conviniently possible. That also helped me tweak my code and re-plan my steps when facing deadends in my initial mapping or when encountering inescapable Exceptions.

Nonetheless, and prior to taking any small reverse engineering approach, I tried to stay up-close to some key principles which are a _sine qua non_ requisits in each and every project, whatever their size and scope can be. These are **understanding the problem statement** - to the extent as though _you created it_ - , **exploring** and **becoming oneself familiar with the provided datasets**.

Thanks for reading this and happy coding!
