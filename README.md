## Summary

In this course, I employ TensorFlow framework to build several Neural Networks and explore more advanced techniques like Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I also dive into Neural Networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional Neural Networks operate.

## Projects:

  - **[Rock Paper Scissors]**


## How to test these:

  1. For each project, download the `py files` (x3) in their respective py files folders and also the csv files.
  2. Save them all in the same directory/folder.
  3. Open a terminal in VS Code - or any other IDE - and run the `main.py` file ("python main.py")
