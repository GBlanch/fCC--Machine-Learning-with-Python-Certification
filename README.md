## Summary

In this course, I employ TensorFlow framework to build several Neural Networks and explore more advanced techniques like Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I also dive into Neural Networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional Neural Networks operate.

## Projects:

  - [Rock Paper Scissors]
  - [Cat and Dog Image Classifier](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Machine-Learning-with-Python-Certification/tree/main/1.cat_and_dog_image_classifier)
  - [Book Recommendation Engine using KNN]
  - [Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator]
  - [Neural Network SMS Text Classifier]


## How to test these:

  1. For each project, download the `py files`  in their respective py files folders and also the csv files.
  2. Save them all in the same directory/folder.
  3. Open a terminal in VS Code - or any other IDE - and run the `main.py` file ("python main.py")
