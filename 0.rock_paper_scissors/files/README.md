The rest of the environment configuration and python files were provided by freeCodeCamp, as indicated in the link above.

This problem constitutes the first of the 5 challenges which form part of the [_**Machine Learning with Python**_ certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/), engineered by **freeCodeCamp**. More details about my solutions to these problems are located in [my GitHub repository](https://github.com/GBlanch/fCC-Machine-Learning-with-Python-Certification/tree/main).
