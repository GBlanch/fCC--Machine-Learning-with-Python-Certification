Coding in progress

## Summary

In this course, I employ TensorFlow framework to build several Neural Networks and explore more advanced techniques like Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. I also dive into Neural Networks, and learn the principles behind how deep, recurrent, and convolutional Neural Networks operate.

## Projects:
