In the case of this ML course,  since an IDE is being used to develop and test the all the code, it's about understanding the  **test_function**.\n","\n","[Go to _Understanding the **test_function**_](#understand-the-test-function)\n","\n","Another noteworthy habit that helped me organize and map what I was coding was to utilize constants and variables as much as conviniently possible. That also helped me tweak my code and re-plan my steps when facing deadends in my initial mapping or when encountering inescapable Exceptions.\n","\n","Nonetheless, and prior to taking any small reverse engineering approach, I tried to stay up-close to some key principles which are a _sine qua non_ requisits in each and every project, whatever their size and scope can be. These are **understanding the problem statement** - to the extent as though _you created it_ - , **exploring** and **becoming oneself familiar with the provided datasets**.\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","Thanks for reading this and happy coding!\n","\n","&nbsp;\n","&nbsp;\n","\n","G.Blanch\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"GBXSdOTtRNKL"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Y1onB6kUvo4Z"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import libraries (you may add additional imports but you may not have to)\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\n","from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"iAQGqqO_vo4d","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1704685091553,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":7665,"user":{"displayName":"Gerry Blanch","userId":"12427716774884151771"}},"outputId":"1bf967a3-4ed4-4eae-b065-89f1b8e8aa9d"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["--2024-01-08 03:38:03--  https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/books/book-crossings.zip\n","Resolving cdn.freecodecamp.org (cdn.freecodecamp.org)... 104.26.2.33, 104.26.3.33, 172.67.70.149, ...\n","Connecting to cdn.freecodecamp.org (cdn.freecodecamp.org)|104.26.2.33|:443... connected.\n","HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK\n","Length: 26085508 (25M) [application/zip]\n","Saving to: ‘book-crossings.zip.5’\n","\n","book-crossings.zip. 100%[===================>]  24.88M  50.6MB/s    in 0.5s    \n","\n","2024-01-08 03:38:04 (50.6 MB/s) - ‘book-crossings.zip.5’ saved [26085508/26085508]\n","\n","Archive:  book-crossings.zip\n","replace BX-Book-Ratings.csv?
